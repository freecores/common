//  This directory contains files which are too small to be projects in themselves.
//
//  Examples of such files might be:
//    prototype copyright files
//    parameterizable cell libraries
//    files which implement some interesting low-level function
//    files which are used as components in several projects
//
//  Each file should be self-documenting so that a quick glance would serve
//    to explain what it is and why it is here.
//
//  As a courtesy, each file could also have a small entry here to make it
//    easy to browse the directory looking for interesting stuff.
//
//  "synchronizer_flop.v" is a behaviorial description of a 1-bit flop.
//    It should be manually instantiated in EACH AND EVERY MODULE which
//      uses a flop to synchronize a signal from one clock domain to another.
//    In real use, the user of this file will generate a simulation module
//      which will behave like a normal flop when presented with 1, 0, X, or Z.
//    This special-purpose module will NOT have setup and hold tests.  It will
//      NOT convert a valid value into an X due to setup timing being violated.
//    This module makes it possible to simulate gate-level netlists with
//      multiple clock domains without fear of making inappropriate X's.
