// Web definition of Plesiochronous:
// "Signals which are arbitrarily close in frequency to some defined precision.
//  They are not sourced from the same clock and so, over the long term, will
//  be skewed from each other.  Their relative closeness of frequency allows a
//  switch to cross connect, switch, or in some way process them.  That same
//  inaccuracy of timing will force a switch, over time, to repeat or delete
//  frames (called frame slips) in order to handle buffer underflow or overflow."
//
// Summary:  Make a FIFO which is used to cross between 2 Pleasiochronous
//             clock domains.
//           This code assumes that latency does not matter.
//           This code assumes that the FIFO is being used for packet IO.
//           This code REQUIRES that the reader of the FIFO reads an entire
//             packet in back-to-back clocks, with no dead cycles.
//           This code REQUIRES that the writer of the FIFO leaves dead cycles
//             when writing the FIFO, so that it does not overflow.
//
// NOTE:  This FIFO REQUIRES that the Sender ALWAYS sends a full packet into
//          the FIFO on adjacent Sender-side clocks.  NO WAIT STATES except at
//          packet boundries.  The Sender promises this to the Receiver.
//
// NOTE:  This FIFO REQUIRES that the Receiver ALWAYS receives a full packet
//          out of the FIFO as soon as it gets an indication that the FIFO
//          is half full.  NO WAIT STATES.  The Receiver promises this to
//          the Sender.
//
// NOTE:  The Read side has to capture the Read Data IMMEDIATELY.  It must
//          wrap read_fifo_half_full back directly to read_consume, and must
//          capture and use the data it captures the first clock read_consume
//          is asserted.  read_consume means data valid to the receiver logic.
//
// NOTE:  A plesiochronous system is one in which the different clock domains
//          are running at different frequencies, but the designer knows how
//          far apart the system frequencies are worst case.  The designer
//          can use this knowledge to make the system seem fully synchronous.
//
// NOTE:  The system does NOT need to have the same frequencies for both the
//          reader and the writer, if the widths of the interfaces are different.
//        For instance, assume that the sender runs at N MHz with an M bit
//          interface.  The receiver might run at N/2 MHz with a 2*M bit
//          interface.
//        As long as there are bounds on the variations of the sender's N MHz
//          clock and the receiver's N/2 MHz clock, the system can be
//          considered to be plesiochronous.
//
// NOTE:  The idea:  The Sender writes data into the FIFO.  Every so often,
//          BUT ONLY AT A PACKET BOUNDRY, the sender intentionally does not
//          write to the FIFO for 1 clock.
//        The Receiver watches the FIFO.  The receiver does not START reading
//          from the FIFO until the FIFO becomes half full.  Once it starts
//          reading, it removes an entire packet from the FIFO all at once.
//        The Sender can be sure that it will not overrun the FIFO, because
//          it knows that the Receiver is emptying it.  Even if the Sender is
//          filling faster than the Receiver is emptying, the bounded
//          difference in frequencies lets the Sender know that it cannot
//          fill up the FIFO before it skips a write.
//        The skipped write cycle keeps the Sender from over-filling the
//          FIFO in the long run.
//        The Receiver knows that it can receive an entire packet from the
//          FIFO without emptying it.  Even if the Receiver is emptying the
//          FIFO faster than the Sender is filling it, the bounded
//          difference in frequencies lets the Receiver know that it cannot
//          empty the FIFO before it finishes reading a full packet.
//        As soon as the Receiver finishes reading a packet, it waits until
//          the FIFO gets at least half full again.  The wait may be for
//          more than 1 clock.  The waits until the FIFO is half full keeps
//          the Receiver from emptying the FIFO inthe ling run.
//          
// NOTE:  You have to tell the FIFO the paramaters of the clocks and packets
//          you are designing for.  This lets the FIFO calculate whether it
//          can safely meet the design goals.
//
// NOTE:  In this case, the FIFO is ALWAYS 6 elements deep.  There are 6 entries
//          instead of 4 to handle cases I can't imagine involving clock jitter.
//
// NOTE:  This module instantiates synchronizer_flop.v, available at
//          www.opencores.com/
//
// This code was developed using VeriLogger Pro, by Synapticad.
// Their support is greatly appreciated.

// The latest is when the Sender writes word 0, then word 1, BUT the indication

//   NEXT clock.  At that time, the Sender writes entry 2.
// The Receiver unloads data from word 0 at the same time the sender writes word 3.

// The FIFO has 3 valid words in it at the start.
// If the Sender writes faster than the Receiver reads, the FIFO can work up to
//   having 4 words of valid data in it.

// The Receiver needs to know that it will not run out of data if it unloads
//   faster than the Sender sends.  How can it check this?
// The earliest the Receiver can know that data is available is if the Sender
//   writes word 0, the word 1, and the Receiver hears about the data available
//   instantly.  Then, the Sender writes word 2 while the receiver unloads word 0.
//   So the FIFO has valid data in locations 1 and 2.

// Having 4 words max and 1 word min are fine constraints on the FIFO's behavior.
// To meet the constraints, the Sender and Receiver clocks must not vary too far
//   from one-another.  If they got too far apart, too much data would be either
//   read or written throught the FIFO.
